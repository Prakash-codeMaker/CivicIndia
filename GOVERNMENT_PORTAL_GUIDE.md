**UI/UX:**
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Loading states for each step

#### Usage

```typescript
import GovernmentAuth from './components/GovernmentAuth';

        console.log('Authentication successful:', data);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

#### Test Credentials

For testing, use any email ending with `@gov.in` or `@nic.in`:

### Technical Stack

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Recharts** - Chart library
- **localStorage** - Session management

## Mock Data

The dashboard uses mock data for demonstration:
- Department performance
- Report trends
- Priority distribution
- Recent activities
- Statistics

Replace with real API calls in production.

## Testing

### Authentication Flow

1. Enter email: `employee@gov.in`
2. Check console for OTP (for testing)
3. Upload employee ID file (any PDF/Image)
4. Enter OTP from console
5. Select department
6. Complete verification

### Dashboard Features

- View statistics and charts
- Navigate between sections
- Test role-based access
- Check responsive design
- Export reports (placeholder)

## Production Considerations

### Authentication

1. **OTP Service**: Integrate real email/SMS service
2. **File Upload**: Use cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.)
3. **Backend API**: Replace mock validation with real API
4. **Session Management**: Consider JWT tokens
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement on backend
6. **Logging**: Add audit logs for security events

### Dashboard

1. **Data Source**: Connect to real database
2. **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets or polling
3. **Charts**: Connect to actual analytics API
4. **Export**: Implement PDF/Excel generation
5. **Pagination**: Add for large datasets
6. **Filters**: Add date range, department filters

## Customization

### Change Department List

Edit `DEPARTMENTS` array in `components/GovernmentAuth.tsx`:

```typescript
const DEPARTMENTS = [
  'Your Department 1',
  'Your Department 2',
  // Add more
];
```

### Modify Email Domains

Edit `GOVERNMENT_EMAIL_DOMAINS` array:

```typescript
const GOVERNMENT_EMAIL_DOMAINS = [
  '@yourdomain.gov.in',
  '@yourdomain.nic.in',
];
```

### Adjust Session Timeout

Change `SESSION_TIMEOUT` constant:

```typescript
const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
```
